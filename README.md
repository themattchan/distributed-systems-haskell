# distributed-systems-haskell

# TODO
1. Literature review, write background and method paper
2. Collect 3-4 interesting examples in this repo + refactor them to support
   QuickCheck


# Topics mentioned in discussion that we should look into
- Consensus Protocols
- [Cloud Haskell](http://haskell-distributed.github.io/)
- Concurrent Programming in Erlang
- Aphyr Jepsen
- Building Quick Check support on Distributed Systems
- Parameterise the example programs by a typeclass, then provide different instances for (a) actual running (b) testing/loggint/etc
- perhaps this would be useful: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MuCheck-QuickCheck
